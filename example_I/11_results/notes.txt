Simulation details:

N_chains = 3, n = 2
jump_ops = [gamma * embed(sigmam(), idx, N_chains*n) for idx in range(N_chains*n)] with gamma=0.25
initial and target states are density matrices (cos(theta/2)*|011> + sin(theta/2)*exp(i*phi)*|101>)
with random theta in [0, pi], phi in [0, 2pi] (uniform distributions).

To initial state noise term  (eps * |000><000|) was added where
eps random uniform distributions between ±noise (noise level is written into filenames).

Training is performed with noise and evaluation without.

Every model is randomly initialized 3 time and trained for 1000 iterations. We select the one with best mean fidelity across 100 segments.
