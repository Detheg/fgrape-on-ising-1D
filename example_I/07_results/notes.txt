Simulation details:

N_chains = 2, n = 2
jump_ops = [gamma * embed(sigmam(), idx, N_chains*n) for idx in range(N_chains*n)] with gamma=0.25
initial and target states are density matrices (cos(theta/2)*|01> + sin(theta/2)*exp(i*phi)*|10>)
with random theta in [0, pi], phi in [0, 2pi] (uniform distributions).

To initial state noise term  (eps * |00><00|) was added where
eps random uniform distributions between ±noise (noise level is written into filenames).

Training is performed with noise and evaluation without.

Every model is randomly initialized 10 times. We select the one with best mean fidelity across 100 segments.
